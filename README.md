# PowerFlow Solver
Application for solving the power flow problem using the Newton-Raphson method

This application/project was developed as a part of the course "Structures and Operational Modes of
Electrical Power Systems", which is part of the Automatic control and electronics undergraduate degree program offered by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo.

The goal of the project was to develop a GUI-based application that solves a problem related to the coursework. In this case, it solves the power flow problem using the Newton-Raphson method.

It is written in C++. GTK4 framework is used for GUI creation.

The repository contains the source code and unit tests. Unit tests are used to test the backend of the application, and are written using Microsoft's C++ Unit Testing Framework.
